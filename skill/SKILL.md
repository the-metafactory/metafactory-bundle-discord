# Discord Skill

Discord CLI for posting updates and reading channels — like `gh` for GitHub.

> *"From PAI to Discord. Discord to PAI is done through Grove."*

## CLI Tool

Discord uses a CLI at `~/bin/discord`. **All commands are bash commands:**

```bash
discord post "Your message here"           # Post to default channel
discord post --channel tasks "PR merged"   # Post to specific channel
discord read                               # Read last 10 messages
discord channels                           # List server channels
discord threads                            # List active threads
```

Run `discord --help` for full command list.

### Multi-server (posting to a guild other than grove)

The bot can be in several guilds with the same token. Target another guild
either by a one-off `--guild <id>` (overrides the guild used for channel/thread
name resolution) or by a saved `--server <name>` profile:

```bash
# One-off: resolve the channel name in the halden guild
discord post --guild 1512054429023731884 --channel general "Deployed halden"

# Saved profile (register once, then reference by name):
discord config set-server halden 1512054429023731884 general
discord post --server halden "Deployed halden"
discord read  --server halden
```

Precedence: explicit `--guild`/`--channel` flags  >  `--server` profile  >
top-level config. With neither flag, behaviour is identical to single-guild.
Cached `channels.<name>.id` entries are used only when their owning guild
matches the selected `--guild`/`--server` context; otherwise the CLI resolves
the name inside the selected guild or fails loudly.

## Workflow Routing

**When executing operations:**
-> **READ:** The workflow file first
-> **EXECUTE:** Follow the workflow steps

| Action | Workflow | Trigger Examples |
|--------|----------|------------------|
| **Post** | [Post](Workflows/Post.md) | "post to discord", "send message to discord", "notify channel", "announce" |
| **Read** | [Read](Workflows/Read.md) | "read discord", "check discord messages", "what's happening on discord" |

---

## Setup

If `discord config show` returns empty, guide the user:

1. `discord config set botToken <token>`
2. `discord config set guildId <id>`
3. `discord config set defaultChannel <name>`

For a second guild the bot has joined (e.g. halden), register a profile:

4. `discord config set-server halden <guildId> [defaultChannel]`

Or hand-edit the `servers:` block in the config file:

```yaml
servers:
  halden:
    guildId: "1512054429023731884"
    defaultChannel: general   # optional; falls back to top-level
    # botToken / channels optional — omitted fields fall back to top-level
```

Config stored at `~/.config/cortex/cli.yaml` (read cortex-first with a `~/.config/grove/cli.yaml` fallback during the GV-1 transition; first write migrates the legacy copy).

## Attachments

`discord post --file <path>` attaches a local file (repeatable); the message text is optional when a file is present. Files are read + existence-checked before the post, so a bad path posts nothing.
